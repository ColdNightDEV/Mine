        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        
        <p>Outerverse Vessels is a collection of 1750 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. This website is only an interface
            allowing users to learn about the project and potentially mint one of the 1750 digital collectibles. Users are
            entirely responsible for the safety and management of their personal Ethereum wallets and collectibles and for
            validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Additionally, because the
            Outerverse Vessels contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is the ability to undo, reverse, or restore any
            transactions.</p>
            
            <p>This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By
                using this website, you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Outerverse
                Vessels digital collectibles.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Ownership</h2>

    <p>You Own the NFT. Each Outerverse Vessel is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase, you own and are
        in charge of it and any underlying benefits and utility. Because all transactions and Ownership of the NFT are
        mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise
        modify the ownership of any Outerverse Vessel NFT.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
        
        <p>You are solely responsible for your own actions and behavior while accessing or using the website and for any
            consequences. You agree to use the Site only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these
            Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If you decide to purchase an Outerverse Vessels NFT through the website, any financial transactions that you
                    engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no knowledge of or control
                    over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. Accordingly, we
                    will have no liability to you or any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any
                    transactions you engage in or any other transactions you conduct via the Ethereum network.</li>
                    <li>Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction on the Ethereum
            network. The Gas Fee funds the computer network that runs the decentralized Ethereum network. This means
            that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Disclaimers: </h2>
        
        <p>WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, NOR DO WE HAVE THE POWER
        OVER IT OR THE ABILITY TO REVERSE OR CHANGE ALREADY EXISTING TRANSACTIONS OR ANY GUARANTEES WITH SMART
        CONTRACTS.</p>
        
        <p>YOU ARE AWARE OF AND ACCEPT THE SECURITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING OVER THE INTERNET AND AGREE THAT WE ARE
