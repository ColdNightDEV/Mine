        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

        <p>Outerverse Vessels is a collection of 1750 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. This website is only an interface
            allowing users to learn about the project and potentially mint one of the 1750 digital collectibles. Users
            are
            entirely responsible for the safety and management of their personal Ethereum wallets and collectibles and
            for
            validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Additionally, because
            the
            Outerverse Vessels contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is the ability to undo, reverse, or restore
            any
            transactions.</p>

        <p>This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind.
            By
            using this website, you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Outerverse
            Vessels digital collectibles.</p>


        <h2>Ownership</h2>

        <p>You Own the NFT. Each Outerverse Vessel is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase, you own and
            are
            in charge of it and any underlying benefits and utility. Because all transactions and Ownership of the NFT
            are
            mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or
            otherwise
            modify the ownership of any Outerverse Vessel NFT.</p>


        <h2>Your Obligations</h2>

        <p>You are solely responsible for your own actions and behavior while accessing or using the website and for any
            consequences. You agree to use the Site only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with
            these
            Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.</p>




        <h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you decide to purchase an Outerverse Vessels NFT through the website, any financial transactions that
                you
                engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no knowledge of or control
                over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.
                Accordingly, we
                will have no liability to you or any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of
                any
                transactions you engage in or any other transactions you conduct via the Ethereum network.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction on the Ethereum
                network. The Gas Fee funds the computer network that runs the decentralized Ethereum network. This means
                that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Disclaimers: </h2>

        <p>WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, NOR DO WE HAVE THE
            POWER
            OVER IT OR THE ABILITY TO REVERSE OR CHANGE ALREADY EXISTING TRANSACTIONS OR ANY GUARANTEES WITH SMART
            CONTRACTS.</p>

        <p>YOU ARE AWARE OF AND ACCEPT THE SECURITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING OVER THE INTERNET AND AGREE THAT WE
            ARE
            NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY SECURITY BREACHES UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR WILFUL MISCONDUCT.</p>

                positive
                or negative effects it can have on your NFT. Do not treat your Outerverse Vessels NFT as an Investment.
                You
                assume all risks in that connection.</li>
                <br>

            <li>You are aware of, accept and assume all the risks associated with using an internet-based currency and

                hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk
                that
                third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.</li>
                <br>
            <li>NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology are relatively new and have new legal requirements and
                jurisdictions. The regulatory future surrounding such technologies is unsettled. New regulations can
                impact
                these technologies and negatively impact your Outerverse Vessels NFT. You are aware of this and accept
                this
                risk. </li>
                <br>
            <li>You assume all responsibility and accept the risk of any effects, issues, or problems that could disrupt
                or
                are currently disrupting and or impacting Ethereum and its platform.</li>
